# Docker-datascience-template
A template folder structure for datascience with docs section included. Run by docker compose.

Run 'docker-compose up' to run an instance of jupyter/scipy-notebook container with Jupyter lab enabled. 
A version of a squidfunk/mkdocs-material container is run in the /docs folder to run your documentation for you. 

Dummy data of the Iris data set is added to these folders, feel free to remove them. 

Happy coding
